# ArchiveODM
A small project to archive ODM docker releases from https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM

This repository will check latest docker release of OpenDroneMap daily and archive the newly released docker images with version tags. The docker image is copied directly from the original repository, which won't guarantee the docker image matches the exact release version.
